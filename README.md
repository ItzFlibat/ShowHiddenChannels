<p align="center">ShowHiddenChannels is a plugin for [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) that allows users to view information about hidden channels in a Discord server, such as their name, description, and which roles or users have access to these hidden channels. By using ShowHiddenChannels, BetterDiscord users can gain a better understanding of their Discord servers and manage their communications more effectively.</p>
<p align="center">**Please note that this plugin will not allow you to read the messages in these channels, it will only show you information about them.**</p>

<p align="center">The original plugin created by [@rauenzi](https://github.com/rauenzi/) for BetterDiscord, which allowed users to view hidden channels within a Discord server, was discontinued and removed from the official BetterDiscordAddons repository. In response to this, a new plugin was created to fill the void and provide users with similar functionality. With this new plugin, BetterDiscord users can once again access important information about hidden channels within their Discord servers.</p>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Warning
Discord has started working on an experimental feature that will hide private channels on the server side, so plugins like this will no longer be functional.
